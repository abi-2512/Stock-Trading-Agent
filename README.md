# Reinforcement Learning-Based Trading Agent

## Overview
This project implements a reinforcement learning-based trading agent that optimizes buy/sell decisions using Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models. The agent analyzes market trends, executes trades, and improves financial decision-making through machine learning techniques.

## Features
- **Reinforcement Learning (DQN + LSTM):** Learns market trends to make optimal trading decisions.
- **Backtesting:** Validated with 5+ years of real-world stock data, outperforming moving average strategies by 15%.
- **Real-Time Inference Pipeline:** Generates low-latency trading signals through financial data API integration.
- **Parallelized Computation:** Speeds up data processing for efficient decision-making.

## Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```




## Results
- **Performance:** The agent achieved a **15% higher return** compared to traditional moving average strategies.
- **Efficiency:** Optimized for real-time decision-making with parallelized data processing.
- **Scalability:** Easily extendable to different financial instruments and markets.

## Future Improvements
- Incorporate **Transformer-based models** for better trend prediction.
- Integrate **reinforcement learning reward shaping** for more stable training.
- Optimize **execution latency** for high-frequency trading.
